# What is this sample?

In this sample we build, evaluate and deploy a support chat agent for Contoso Outdoors, a fictitious retailer who sells hiking and camping equipment. The implementation uses a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach to answer customer queries with responses grounded in the company's product catalog and customer purchase history.

The sample uses the following Azure technologies:
- [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/) to create and manage search indexes for product catalog data
- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/) to store and manage customer purchase history data
- [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/) to deploy and manage key models for our copilot workflow
    - `text-embeddings-ada-002` for vectorizing user queries
    - `gpt-4` for AI-assisted evaluation
    - `gpt-35-turbo` for generating chat responses

By exploring and deploying this sample, you will learn to:
- Build a retail copilot application using the _RAG pattern_.
- Define and engineer prompts using the _Prompty_ asset.
- Design, run & evaluate a copilot using the _Promptflow_ framework.
- Provision and deploy the solution to Azure using the _Azure Developer CLI_.
- Explore and understand Responsible AI practices for _evaluation and content safety._

## Version History

This is the signature sample for showcasing end-to-end development of a copilot application **code-first** on the Azure AI platform and has been actively used for training developer audiences and partners at signature events including [Microsoft AI Tour](https://aka.ms/msaitour) and [Microsoft Build](https://aka.ms/msbuild). This section maintains links to prior versions associated with the relevant events and workshops for reference.

This sample builds the _chat AI_ (copilot backend) that can be deployed to Azure AI Studio as a hosted API (endpoint) for integrations with front-end applications. For **demonstration purposes only**, the _chat UI_ (retail front-end website) was prototyped in a second sample: [contoso-web](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-web) that provides the user experience shown below. Revisit this section for future updates on chat-UI samples that are Azure AI template ready for convenience.

## Architecture Diagram

The Contoso Chat application implements a _retrieval augmented generation_ pattern to ground the model responses in your data. The architecture diagram below illustrates the key components and services used for implementation and highlights the use of [Azure Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/) to reduce developer complexity in managing sensitive credentials.

# Getting Started

## 1. Pre-Requisites

- **Azure Subscription** - [Signup for a free account here.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- **Visual Studio Code** - [Download it for free here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- **GitHub Account** - [Signup for a free account here.](https://github.com/signup)
- **Access to Azure Open AI Services** - [Apply for access here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access)

You will also need to validate the following requirements:
 - Access to [semantic ranker feature](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=search) for your search service tier and deployment region.
 - Access to [sufficient Azure OpenAI quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits) for your selected models and deployment region.

 > ![!Note]
 > In this template, we have _pre-configured_ Azure AI Search for deployment in `eastus`, while all other resources get deployed to the default `location` specified during the _azd-driven_ deployment. This is primarily due to the limited regional availability of the _semantic ranker_ feature at present. By using a default location for the search resource, we can now be more flexible in selecting the location for deploying other resources (e.g., to suit your model quota availability).
 
## 2. Setup Environment

You have three options for getting started with this template:
 - **GitHub Codespaces** - Cloud-hosted dev container (pre-built environment)
 - **VS Code Dev Containers** - Locally-hosted dev container (pre-built environment)
 - **Manual Setup** - Local environment setup (for advanced users)

We recommend the first option for the quickest start with minimal effort required. The last option requires the most user effort offers maximum control over your setup. All three options are documented below - **pick one**. 

Once you complete setup, use these commands to validate the install:

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```
 1. Verify that your application was provisioned correctly.
    - Visit the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and verify the resource group (above) was created.
    - Visit the [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/build) site and verify the AI project was created.
  1. **Congratulations!** Your setup step is complete. 
 
### Local Development

The core functionality of the copilot application is developed using the Promptflow framework with Python. In this project, we use the Promptflow extension in Visual Studio Code, with its `pf` commandline tool, for all our local development needs. 

🚨 **TODO**
