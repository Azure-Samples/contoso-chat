# Contoso Chat Retail with Azure AI Studio and Promptflow

This sample creates a customer support chat agent for an online retailer called Contoso Outdoors. The solution uses a _retrieval-augmented generation pattern_ to ground responses in the company's product and customer data. Customers can ask questions about the retailer's product catalog, and also get recommendations based on their prior purchases.

# About This Sample

In this sample we build, evaluate and deploy a customer support chat AI for Contoso Outdoors, a fictitious retailer who sells hiking and camping equipment. The implementation uses a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to implement a retail copilot solution that responds to customer queries with answers grounded in the company's product catalog and customer purchase history.

The sample uses [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/) to create and manage search indexes for product catalog data, [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/) to store and manage customer purchase history data, and [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/) to deploy and manage the core models required for our RAG-based architecture.

By exploring and deploying this sample, you will learn to:
- Build a retail copilot application using the [_RAG pattern_](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation).
- Define and engineer prompts using the [_Prompty_ asset](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/tutorials/prompty-quickstart.html?highlight=prompty#).
- Design, run & evaluate a copilot using the [_Promptflow_ framework](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/tutorials/flex-flow-quickstart.html).
- Provision and deploy the solution to Azure using the [_Azure Developer CLI_](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/).
- Understand and apply Responsible AI practices like [_evaluation and content safety_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/responsible-use-of-ai-overview?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext).

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - recommended IDE for local development.
* [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd) - to manage Azure deployment.
* [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - to run, test & evaluate application.
* [Promptflow 1.10+](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/) - to build, evaluate, and deploy application flows.

You will also need:
* [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) - sign up for a free account.
* [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup) - sign up for a free account.
* [Access to Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access) - submit form to request access.

### Setup Environment

You have three options for getting started with this template:
 - **GitHub Codespaces** - Cloud-hosted dev container (pre-built environment)
 - **VS Code Dev Containers** - Locally-hosted dev container (pre-built environment)
 - **Manual Setup** - Local environment setup (for advanced users)

We recommend using GitHub Codespaces for the fastest start with least effort. However, we have provided instructions for all three options below.

### 1. GitHub Codespaces

 1. Click the button to launch this repository in GitHub Codespaces.
  
    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=725257907&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&geo=UsEast)

 1. This opens a new browser tab with setup taking a few minutes to complete. Once ready, you should see a Visual Studio Code editor in your browser tab, with a terminal open.
 1. Sign into your Azure account from the VS Code terminal
    ```bash
    azd auth login --use-device-code
    ```

### 2. VS Code Dev Containers

This is a related option that opens the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) instead. This is a useful alternative if your GitHub Codespaces quota is low, or you need to work offline.

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
1. Open the project by clickjing the button below:

    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azure-samples/contoso-chat)

 1. Once ready, the tab will refresh to show a Visual Studio Code editor with a terminal open. 
 1. Sign into your Azure account from the VS Code terminal
    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

### 3. Manual Setup (Local)

* Verify you have Python3 installed on your machine.
* Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Install [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
  * Windows: `winget install microsoft.azd`
  * Linux: `curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash`
  * MacOS: `brew tap azure/azd && brew install azd`
* Sign into your Azure account from the VS Code terminal

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

## Azure Deployment

1. Use the same terminal where you previously authenticated with Azure.
1. Provision and deploy your application to Azure. You will need to specify a valid subscription, deployment location, and environment name. 

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```
 1. You will be asked a couple of questions.
    - For Environment Name, enter: CONTOSOCHAT
      - (You are free to choose a different name, for example if you already have resources with that name.)
    - For Subscription, select the default (your logged-in Azure subscription)    
    - For Azure Region we recommend: France Central (francecentral)
 1. This step will take some time to complete. 
    - Visit the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) to monitor progress.
    - Look for a new resource group matching the environment name
    - Click `Deployments` to track the status of the provisioning process
 1. Once provisioning completes, monitor progress for app deployment.
    - Visit [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/build), and click "Sign in"
    - Click "View all projects"
    - Look for an AI Project associated with the above resource group
    - Click `Deployments` to track the status of the application deployment
 1. Once deployment completes, test the deployed endpoint from Azure AI Studio
    - Click the newly-created `chat-deployment-xx` endpoint listed
    - In the details page, click the `Test` tab for a built-in testing sandbox
    - In the `Input` box, enter a new query in this format and submit it:
        ```
        {"question": "Tell me about hiking shoes", "customerId": "2", "chat_history": []}
        ```
    - If successful, the response will be printed in the area below this prompt.

You can find your deployed retail copilot's _Endpoint_ and _Primary Key_ information on the deployment details page in the last step. Use them to configure your preferred front-end application (e.g., web app) to support a customer support chat UI capability that interacts with the deployed copilot in real time.  

## Local Development

With the necessary dependencies installed, you can use your local machine to interact with the deployed endpoint. Or, you can use Codespaces or a devcontainer on this repository, which will work out of the box.

### Exploring the Prompty Asset

The [contoso_chat](./contoso_chat) sample contains an example [chat.prompty](./contoso_chat/chat.prompty) asset that you can explore, to understand this new capability. The file has the following components:

1. A frontmatter section that defines the following attributes:
    - `name` of the application
    - `description` of the application functionality
    - `authors` of the application (one per line)
    - `model` description (with these parameters)
        - `api` type of endpoint (can be chat or completion)
        - `configuration` parameters including
            - `type` of connection (azure_openai or openai)
            -  environment variables (e.g., azure_deployment for chat model)
        - `parameters` (max_tokens, temperature, response_format)
    - `inputs` - each with type and optional default value
    - `outputs` - specifying a type (e.g., string)
    - `sample` - an example of the inputs (e.g., for testing)
1. A `system` context (defining the agent persona and behavior)
    - `#Safety` section enforcing responsible AI requirements
    - `#Documentation` section with template for filling product documentation
    - `#Previous Orders` section with template for filling relevant history
    - `#Customer Context` section with template for filling customer details
    - `question` section to embed user query
    - `Instructions` section to reference related product recommendations

This specific prompty takes 3 inputs: a `customer` object, a `documentation` object (that could be chat history) and a `question` string that represents the user query. You can now _load_, _execute_, and _trace_ individual prompty assets for a more granular prompt engineering solution.

 * See the [prompty specification](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/develop-a-prompty/index.html#prompty-specification) for more details on the format.
 * Read the [prompty examples](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow/tree/main/examples/prompty) for usage guidance from SDK or CLI.

### Testing the Application Flow

This sample uses a [flex-flow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/develop-a-flex-flow/index.html) feature that lets you "create LLM apps using a Python class or function as the entry point" - making it easier to test and run them using a code-first experience.
  - This sample implements a _Function based flow_ 
  - The entry point is the _get_response_ functionin `chat_request.py`

You can now [test the flow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/develop-a-flex-flow/function-based-flow.html#flow-test) in different ways:
 - Run it directly, like any Python script
 - Convert it to a flow, then use `pf flow test --flow ...`
 - Start a UI to chat with the flow using `pf flow test --flow ... --ui`

ðŸŒŸ | Watch this space for more testing guidance.


## Guidance

### Region Availability

This template uses `gpt-35-turbo` for chat completion, `gpt-4` for chat evaluation and `text-embedding-ada-002` for vectorization. These models may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#standard-deployment-model-availability) and select a region accordingly.

This template uses the `Semantic Ranker` feature of Azure AI Search which may be available only in certain regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=search) and select a region accordingly.

  * We recommend using `francecentral` for the OpenAI Models
  * We recommend using `eastus` for the Azure AI Search Resource

> [!NOTE]
> The default _azd deploy_ takes a single `location` for deploying all resources within the resource group for that application. We set the default Azure AI Search location to `eastus` (in `infra/` configuration), allowing you to now use the default _location_ setting to optimize for model availability and capacity in region.
  

### Costs

Pricing for services may vary by region and usage and exact costs cannot be estimated. You can estimate the cost of this project's architecture with [Azure's pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) with these services:

- Azure OpenAI - Standard tier, GPT-4, GPT-35-turbo and Ada models.  [See Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
- Azure AI Search - Basic tier, Semantic Ranker enabled [See Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/search/)
- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL - Serverless, Free Tier [See Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cosmos-db/autoscale-provisioned/#pricing)

### Security

This template uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for authentication with key Azure services including Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure Cosmos DB. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Microsoft Entra tokens without having to manage any credentials. This also removes the need for developers to manage these credentials themselves and reduces their complexity.

Additionally, we have added a [GitHub Action tool](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action) that scans the infrastructure-as-code files and generates a report containing any detected issues. To ensure best practices we recommend anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled in your repo.
