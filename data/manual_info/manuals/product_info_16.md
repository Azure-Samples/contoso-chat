## Caution Information

1. Do not overload the daypack beyond its recommended weight capacity. Exceeding the weight limit can strain the backpack's seams, zippers, and overall structure, leading to potential damage or discomfort.
2. Do not expose the daypack to extreme temperatures or harsh weather conditions for extended periods. Extreme heat or cold can affect the integrity of the materials and compromise the performance of the backpack.
3. Do not use the daypack as a seat or place excessive pressure on it. Sitting or stepping on the daypack can damage the contents inside and put unnecessary stress on the backpack's construction.
4. Do not drag the daypack on rough surfaces or drag it behind you. This can cause abrasion and tears on the fabric, compromising the durability of the backpack.
5. Do not submerge the daypack in water or expose it to heavy rain without using a rain cover or waterproofing solution. While the daypack may offer some water resistance, it is not fully waterproof and can allow water to seep through zippers and seams.
6. Do not use sharp objects or knives directly on the daypack. This can puncture or tear the fabric, reducing the backpack's functionality and compromising its overall lifespan.
7. Do not store the daypack in damp or dirty conditions for extended periods. Moisture and dirt can lead to mold or mildew growth, unpleasant odors, and potential damage to the backpack's materials.
8. Do not modify or alter the daypack's design or structure. Any unauthorized modifications can compromise the backpack's integrity, safety, and warranty coverage.
9. Do not neglect regular cleaning and maintenance of the daypack. Proper care and upkeep, as outlined in the user guide, are essential to preserve the backpack's performance and longevity.
10. Do not disregard any warnings or instructions provided by the manufacturer. Always follow the guidelines outlined in the user manual to ensure safe and proper use of the TrailLite Daypack.

By adhering to this NOT TO DO list, you can maximize the lifespan and performance of your TrailLite Daypack while ensuring a safe and enjoyable outdoor experience.
