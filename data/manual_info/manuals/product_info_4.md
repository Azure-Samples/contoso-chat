6. **Do not ignore proper fit and sizing:** Ensure that you choose the correct size and fit for your feet when purchasing the TrekReady Hiking Boots. Wearing ill-fitting boots can lead to discomfort, blisters, and potential foot injuries. Take the time to try them on and make necessary adjustments for a proper fit.

7. **Do not neglect proper maintenance:** Proper maintenance is essential to prolong the lifespan of your TrekReady Hiking Boots. Regularly clean and dry the boots after each use, store them in a suitable environment, and follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer.

8. **Do not disregard safety precautions:** While the TrekReady Hiking Boots provide support and protection, they do not guarantee immunity from accidents or injuries. Always exercise caution and follow proper hiking safety guidelines, such as using trekking poles, wearing appropriate clothing, and being aware of your surroundings.

By keeping these "not-to-do" points in mind, you can ensure the optimal performance, durability, and safety of your TrekReady Hiking Boots.
