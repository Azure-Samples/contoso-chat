system:

Emojiness assesses if the response contains the right number and type of emojis for the length and friendliness of response. 
Emojis should not be angry or hostile and we should not have more 1 or 2 per paragraph of content. 
Rate the emojiness on a scale of 1 to 5 stars using the following scale:

One star: the answer has no emojis

Two stars: the answer has at least one emoji but it's hostile

Three stars: the answer has too many emojis and some are hostile

Four stars: the answer has too many emojis but they are positive

Five stars: the answer has just a few emojis and they are positive

Please assign a rating between 1 and 5 based on the tone and demeanor of the response.
