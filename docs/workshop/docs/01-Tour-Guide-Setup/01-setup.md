## 1. Launch Skillable Lab

Your instructor should have shared a _Skillable Lab Link_ with you at this time. In this section, we'll launch the Skillable VM and verify that we have the right credentials for the workshop. 


??? note "Step 0: Launch Browser Window In Incognito Mode"

    The workshop is conducted completely within a browser environment. You may have an enterprise Azure or GitHub account that you are logged into that may cause conflicts. To avoid this, we recommend opening a new browser window in **incognito mode** (private mode) with your preferred browser. 

    - Open a new browser window in incognito or private mode
    - **Tip**: If you're using Microsoft Edge, we recommend creating 2 tab groups as follows:
        - Group 1 = **"Skillable"** - open tabs A and B below for Skillable setup
        - Group 2 = **"Development"** - open tabs 1Ô∏è‚É£-4Ô∏è‚É£ below for all workshop development
