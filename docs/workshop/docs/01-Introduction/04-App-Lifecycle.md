# 4. The App Lifecycle

Building generative AI applications requires an iterative process of refinement from _prompt_ to _production_. The application  lifecycle (GenAIOps) is best illustrated by the three stages shown:

1. **Ideation** - involves building the initial prototype, validating it manually with a test prompt.
2. **Evaluation** - involves assessing it for quality and safety with large, diverse test datasets.
3. **Operationalization** - involves deploying it for real-world usage & monitoring it for insights.

In our workshop, you willl see the development workflow organized into sections that mimic this lifecycle - giving you a more intuitive sense for how you can iteratively go from promt to production, code-first, with Azure AI.
