=== "Contoso Web (Chat UI)"

    **Contoso Outdoors** is an enterprise retailer that sells a wide variety of hiking and camping equipment to outdoor adventurer through their website. Customers visiting the site often call the customer support line with requests for product information or recommendations, before making their purchases. The retailer decides to build and integrate an AI-based _customer support agent_ (retail copilot) to handle these queries right from their website, for efficiency.

=== "Contoso Chat (Chat AI)"

    **Contoso Chat** is the chat AI implementation (_backend_) for the retail copilot experience. It has a hosted API (_endpoint_) that the chat UI (_frontend_) can interact with to process user requests. Customers can now ask questions in a conversational format, using natural language, and get valid responses grounded in product data and their own purchase history.
