# B. Skillable-Based 

!!! warning "If you are are NOT in an instructor-led session, use the [Self-Guided Setup](./01-Self-Guided.md) instead!"

---

The instructor-led sessions use [Skillable](https://skillable.com), a _lab-on-demand_ platform with a built-in Azure subscription, that pre-provisions the infrastructure for the lab to save you time. Your instructor should provide you a link or QR code for the Skillable Lab at the start of your session.

## 1. Launch Skillable VM

You may have completed this step in-venue, with instructor guidance. If not, please expand the section below to complete the task now. At the end of this step you should have:

- [X] The Skillable VM tab open, with the Azure subscription details shown.
- [X] The Skillable countdown timer visible, with start time of 1h 15 mins.
- [X] The instruction guide open, with this section in focus.

??? example "Step 1.1 Launch Skillable VM"

    The lab instructor should have shared a Skillable Lab link (URL or QR Code).

    - Open the browser and navigate to the link - _verify the lab title is right_.
    - Click the **Launch** button - _wait till the page completes loading_.
        - (Left) You will see a login screen - _we can ignore this for now_
        - (Top Right) You will see a countdown timer - it should start at 1hr 15 mins. 
        - (Right) You should see an instruction pane - _we'll validate this, next_
    - Review the instruction pane details:
        - Check the lab title - should be _Build a Retail Copilot Code-First on Auzre AI_
        - Check the Azure subscription - should have _username & password_ details filled in
        - Check the Workshop guide link - should open to a hosted version of this guide.
     
    **Leave the Skillable tab open in your browser**. We'll use the Azure credentials in the next step. And we'll revisit this tab at the end, to complete lab teardown. You can also track remaining lab time in the countdown timer.

    âœ… **CONGRATULATIONS!** | You setup the Skillable VM tab!

## 2. Launch GitHub Codespaces

Our development environment uses a Visual Studio Code editor with a Python runtime. The Contoso Chat sample repository is instrumented with a [dev container](https://containers.dev) which specifies all required tools and dependencies. At the end of this step you should have:

- [X] Launched GitHub Codespaces to get the pre-built dev environment.
- [X] Fork the sample repo to your personal GitHub profile.

### 2.1 Navigate to GitHub & Login

1. Open a browser tab (T1) and navigate to the link below.
        ``` title="Tip: Click the icon at far right to copy link"
        https://aka.ms/contoso-chat/prebuild
        ```
1. You will be prompted to log into GitHub. **Login now**

### 2.2 Setup GitHub Codespaces

1. You will see a page titled **"Create codespace for Azure-Samples/contoso-chat"**
    - Check that the Branch is `msignite-LAB401`
    - Click dropdown for **2-core** and verify it is `Prebuild ready`

    !!! tip "Using the pre-build makes the GitHub Codespaces load up faster."

1. Click the green "Create codespace" button
    - You should see a new browser tab open to a link ending in `*.github.dev`
    - You should see a Visual Studio Code editor view loading (takes a few mins)
    - When ready, you should see the README for the "Contoso Chat" repository
    
    !!! warning "Do NOT Follow those README instructions. Continue with this workshop guide!"

### 2.3 Fork Repo To Your Profile

The Codespaces is running on the original Azure Samples repo. Let's create a fork from Codespaces, so we have a personal copy to modify. For convenience, we'll follow [this process](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-from-a-template#publishing-to-a-repository-on-github) which streamlines the process once you make any edit.

1. Lets create an empty file from the VS Code Terminal.

    ``` title="Tip: Click the icon at far right to copy command"
    touch .workshop-notes.md
    ```

1. This triggers a notification (blue "1") in Source Control icon on sidebar
1. Click the notification to start the Commit workflow 
1. Enter a commit message ("Forking Contoso Chat") and click "Commit"
1. You will now be prompted to "Publish Branch" 
    - You should see 2 options (remote = original repo, origin = your fork)
    - Select the `origin` option (verify that the URL is to your profile)
1. This will create a fork of the repository in your profile
    - It also updates the GitHub Codespaces to use your fork for commits
    - You are now ready to move to the next step!

### 2.4 Verify Dependencies

Use the following commands in the VS Code terminal to verify these tools are installed.

```bash
python --version
```
```bash
fastapi --version
```
```bash
prompty --version
```
```bash
az version
```
```bash
azd version
```


### 2.5 Authenticate With Azure ðŸš¨

You are now ready to connect your VS Code environment to Azure.

### 2.6 Do Post-Provisioning ðŸš¨

You are now ready to connect your VS Code environment to Azure.
