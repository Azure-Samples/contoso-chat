# 1. Provision & Setup

![Dev Workflow](./../../img/workshop-developer-flow.png)

To get started building our custom copilot, we need to:

 - **SETUP** our development environment and configure it to work with the infrastructure
 - **VALIDATE** that setup completed, before we dive into the ideation phase.
