# 0. Pre-Requisites

=== "Self-Guided"

    ## What You Will Need

    1. **Your own laptop.**
        - Any laptop capable of running a modern browser (and GitHub Codespaces) will do.
        - We recommend having recent version of the Edge, Chrome or Safari browser installed.
    1. **A GitHub Account.**
        - This is needed for creating a copy of the sample, and for launching GitHub Codespaces.
        - If you don't have a GitHub account, [sign up for a free one](https://github.com/signup) now.

    ## What You Should Know
    1. (recommended) **Familiarity with Visual Studio Code** 
        1. The workshop is run completely in GitHub Codespaces, a virtualized Linux machine in the cloud. We do not run any code in your local laptop.
        1. The default editor used in GitHub Codespaces is Visual Studio Code (in browser). The VS Code development environment is pre-configured with required extensions.
        1. If you are familiar with Dev Containers and want to use Docker Desktop (on device), or want to connect to GitHub Codespaces from your local VS Code, feel free to do so.
    1. (preferred) **Familiarity with the `bash` shell**.
        1. We use `bash` in the VS Code terminal to run post-provisioning scripts if needed.
        1. We also use it to run Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI commands during setup. 
    1. (preferred) **Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks**.
        1. We'll create and run Python code scripts from the command-line in some steps.
        1. We'll select the Python kernel and run pre-existing Jupyter Notebooks in some steps.

    ## What You Will Take Away

    On completing this workshop, you will have your own fork of the [Contoso Chat](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat) repository under your GitHub profile. This will contain all the materials you need to reproduce the workshop at home later, with the "Self-Guided" workshop option as a guide.

    You should also have a good understanding of the [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) platform, and a development environment pre-configured with the relevant tooling (e.g., Azure Developer CLI, Prompty, Fast API) to streamline your end-to-end development workflows for generative AI apps.
