!!! warning "To participate in this workshop you will need the following"

1. **Your own laptop.**
    * It need only be capable of running a browser and GitHub Codespaces, so almost any laptop will do.
        * A recent version of the Edge, Chrome or Safari browser is recommended.
1. **A GitHub Account.**
    * If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a free account](https://github.com/signup) now.
    * After this workshop is complete, you will have a fork of the "contoso-chat" repository in your GitHub account, which includes all the materials you will need to reproduce this workshop at home.
1. (recommended) **Familiarity with Visual Studio Code.** 
    * We will run all code in GitHub Codespaces, a virtualized Linux machine, instead of your local laptop. We won't be running anything on your laptop directly.
    * VS Code Online will be our development environment in GitHub Codespaces.
    * If you are familiar with running Codespaces within VS Code Desktop on your laptop, feel free to do so. 
1. (preferred) **Familiarity with the `bash` shell.**
    * We'll be using `bash` to run commands in the VS Code terminal, including Azure CLI commands.
1. (preferred) **Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks**
    * We'll be creating Python scripts and running them from the command line and from Notebooks.

## What You Will Learn

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn to use the Azure AI platform for code-first development of custom copilot solutions:

* **Infrastructure** → Simplified provisioning and deployment with Azure Developer CLI
* **Ideation** → Rapid prototyping with Prompty asset and Azure AI model deployments
* **Evaluation** → Manual and AI-assisted testing with custom evaluators (for quality, safety)
* **Deployment** → Deployment using Azure Container Apps (plus: monitoring & actions)
* **Customization** → adapt sample to your app needs (data, prompts, models, evaluators)


## Pick Your Path

The workshop is designed for delivery on the Microsoft AI Tour as an **instructor-guided** session lasting 75 minutes. It can also be completed as a **self-guided** lab where you walk through the instructions on your own at home. Pick the relevant option and let's get started.
