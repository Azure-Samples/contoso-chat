# 2. Run API Server Locally

This runs a preview version of the API server locally, with hot reload, for rapid iteration.

## 1. Run FastAPI Dev Server

1. Run this command from the root of the repo, in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

    ```bash
    fastapi dev src/api/main.py
    ```

1. Verify that this starts a _development server_ 
    
    - You should see: a pop-up dialog with two options to view the application
    - Select the "Browser" option - should open the preview in a new browser tab
    - Check the browser URL - should be a path ending in `github.dev`
    - Check the page content - should show the "Hello World" message

## 2. Connect the Dots! ðŸ’¡

1. The `github.dev` ending validates the server is hosted by GitHub Codespaces 
    - This verifies we are running in the (local) dev environment. 
    - When deployed to production, you'll see `containerapps.io` (for ACA).

1. What just happened?

    - The dev server ran the `main.py` defined application with 2 routes
    - The default route `/` returns the "Hello world" message (see line 46)
    - This confirms that our application server is running successfully.
