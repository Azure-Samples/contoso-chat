# 3.1 Create a New Prompty

[Prompty](https://prompty.ai) is an open-source project from Microsoft that provides a new asset class (`.prompty`) for LLM prompts, with an emphasis on observability, portability, and understandability. 
The [Prompty Specification](https://prompty.ai/docs/prompty-specification) describe the asset format and functionality in more detail.

The [Prompty Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.prompty) for VS Code simplifies the creation, configuration, and execution, of Prompty assets - bringing the playground experience right into your editor. You can modify template paramters, model configuration, system context and instructions - then execute then with a sample input right in VS Code to view the generated response.

!!! quote "IDEATE WITH PROMPTY - LEARNING OBJECTIVES"

    The Contoso Chat repository defines the chat AI prompt asset in `src/api/contoso_chat/chat.prompty`. This is the final version of the prompt asset used in the production deployment. 
    
    In **this section** we'll start from scratch and build our `.prompty` asset iteratively, till we get close to that final version. The goal is to give you an intuitive sense for **prompt engineering** using the Prompty asset and tooling. To keep this separate from the final version, we'll do our ideation steps in a new **sandbox/** folder.

## 1. Create Sandbox Folder


1. Return to the GitHub Codespaces tab and open the VS Code terminal.
1. Create an empty directory in root of your filesytem. From the Terminal:

    ``` title=""
    mkdir sandbox
    ```
1. Switch to the new directory

    ``` title=""
    cd sandbox
    ```

## 2. Create New Prompty

1. The VS Code Extension makes this easy. 
    - Find the `sandbox` folder in the File explorer sidebar.
    - Right-clock on the folder name to get the drop-down menu
    - Select the `New Prompty` option (at the bottom of drop-down)
1. You should see a `basic.prompty` file that looks like this:

        ```yaml title="basic.prompty"

            The Alpine Explorer Tent boasts a detachable divider for privacy, 
            numerous mesh windows and adjustable vents for ventilation, and 
            a waterproof design. It even has a built-in gear loft for storing 
            your outdoor essentials. In short, it's a blend of privacy, comfort, 
            and convenience, making it your second home in the heart of nature!
        question: What can you tell me about your tents?

        you answer questions briefly, succinctly, and in a personable manner using 
        markdown and even add some personal flair with appropriate emojis.

        # Customer
        You are helping {{firstName}} to find answers to their questions.
        Use their name to address them in your responses.

        # Context
        Use the following context to provide a more personalized response to {{firstName}}:
        {{context}}

        user:
        {{question}}
        ```


## 3. Run The Prompty

!!! danger "NOTE: This step will fail with an error. Don't worry, that's expected."

1. Open the `basic.prompty` file in the VS Code editor.
1. Click the _play icon_ seen at top-right corner (or press F5).
1. You will be prompted to sign in as shown below. Click `Allow`.

    ![The extension 'Prompty' wants to sign in using Microsoft.](./../../img/prompty-auth.png)

1. Select your Azure account when prompted in the dialog.
1. This will complete the run process.
1. **RESULT**: 
    - Your Visual Studio Code terminal will switch to the "Output" tab and show this error:
    - ‚ùå | ` Error: 404 The API deployment for this resource does not exist.`

We can see from the prompty code (line 11) that the `azure-deployment` property value has a placeholder that needs to be updated. Let's fix that, next!
