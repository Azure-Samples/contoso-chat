This workshop is offered in both self-guided and instructor-led formats. Pick the tab that reflects your path - that setting will be enforced throughout this session.


=== "Self-Guided"

    **Select this tab if you are doing this workshop at home, with your subscription**. If you are currently in a Microsoft AI Tour session, select the _Microsoft AI Tour_ tab instead.

    For reference: these are the pre-requisites for getting started in self-guided mode:

    ??? quote "1. WHAT YOU WILL NEED (click to expand)"

        1. **Your own laptop.**
            - Any laptop capable of running a modern browser (and GitHub Codespaces) will do.
            - We recommend having recent version of the Edge, Chrome or Safari browser installed.
            - Make sure your laptop is fully-charged (or connected to power) for the duration of lab.
        1. **A GitHub Account.**
            - This is needed for creating a copy of the sample, and for launching GitHub Codespaces.
            - We recommend using a personal (vs. enterprise) GitHub account for convenience.
            - If you don't have a GitHub account, [sign up for a free one](https://github.com/signup) now. (takes just a few mins)
        1. **An Azure Subscription.**
            - This is needed for provisioning the Azure infrastructure for your AI project.
            - If you don't have an Azure account, [signup for a free one](https://aka.ms/free) now. (takes just a few mins)

    ??? quote "2. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (click to expand)"

        1. (recommended) **Familiarity with Visual Studio Code** 
            1. The workshop is run completely in GitHub Codespaces, a virtualized Linux machine in the cloud. We do not run any code in your local laptop.
            1. The default editor used in GitHub Codespaces is Visual Studio Code (in browser). The VS Code development environment is pre-configured with required extensions.
            1. If you are familiar with Dev Containers and want to use Docker Desktop (on device), or want to connect to GitHub Codespaces from your local VS Code, feel free to do so.
        1. (preferred) **Familiarity with the `bash` shell**.
            1. We use `bash` in the VS Code terminal to run post-provisioning scripts if needed.
            1. We also use it to run Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI commands during setup. 
        1. (preferred) **Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks**.
            1. We'll create and run Python code scripts from the command-line in some steps.
                1. We'll select the Python kernel and run pre-existing Jupyter Notebooks in some steps.

    ??? quote "3. WHAT YOU WILL TAKE AWAY (click to expand)"

        On completing this workshop, you will have:
        
        1. A personal copy of the [Contoso Chat](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat) repository in your GitHub profile. This contains all the materials you need to reproduce the workshop on your own later (e.g., as a _Self-Guided_ session).
        1. Hands-on understanding of the [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) platform and relevant developer tools (e.g., Azure Developer CLI, Prompty, Fast API) to streamline end-to-end development workflows for your own AI apps.


=== "Microsoft AI Tour"
    
    **Continue here only if you are currently in a lab session at a Microsoft AI Tour Stop**. Otherwise switch to the _Self-Guided_ tab on this page to complete the workshop with your own subscription.
