    Looking at our end-to-end developer workflow, we completed the `PROVISION` and `SETUP` stages. Before we dive into the `IDEATE` stage, let's take a minute to validate that we are ready to begin development.

    1. We set up our development environment (GitHub Codespaces)
    1. We provisioned our infrastructure (Azure Resources)
    1. We connected our dev environment to our infra (Auth & Env Vars)
    1. We used SDK and CLI tools to push updates to infra (Data & App)

---

_In this section, we'll take a minute to understand what our Azure infrastructure looks like, and validate that the resources are deployed and initialized correctly. Here's a reminder of the Azure Application Architecure showing the key resources used. Let's dive in._

![ACA Architecture](./../img/aca-architecture.png)

## Step 1: Validate Azure Cosmos DB is populated

The Azure CosmosDB resource holds the customer data for our application. It is a noSQL database that contains JSON data for each customer, and the prior purchases they made.

1. Switch to the **Azure Portal** (Tab 3️⃣) and display the `rg-AITOUR` resource group Overview
1. **Click** the `Azure Cosmos DB account` resource name to visit its details page
1. **Click** `Data Explorer` in the top-nav menu 
    - dismiss the popup dialog to skip the movie
    - see: `contoso-outdoor` container with `customers` database
    - click `customers`, then select `Items`
    - you should see: **12 data items in database**

✅ | Your Azure Cosmos DB resource is ready!

## Step 2: Validate Azure AI Search is populated

The Azure AI Search resources contains the product index for our retailer's product catalog. It is the information **retrieval** service for **R**AG solutions, using sentence similarity and semantic ranking to return the most relevant results for a given customer query.

1. Switch to the Azure Portal (Tab 3️⃣) and display the  `rg-AITOUR` resource group Overview
1. Click the `Search service` resource name to visit its details page
1. Click `Search Explorer` in the top-nav menu  
    - see Search explorer with default index `contoso-products`
    - **click** "Search" with no other input
    - you will see: Results dialog filled with index data for the entire product database.
1. Enter `sleeping bag` in the text box, and click Search
    - Verify that the first result returned relates to a sleeping bag from the catalog
1. Enter `something to make food with` in the text box, and click Search       
    - Verify that the first result returned relates to a camping stove

✅ | Your Azure AI Search resource is ready!

## Step 3: Test the Deployed Container App

When iterating on a prototype application, we start with manual testing - using a single "test prompt" to validate our prioritzed scenario interactively, before moving to automated evaluations with larger test datasets. The FastAPI server exposes a `Swagger API` endpoint that can be used to conduct such testing in both local (Codespaces) and cloud (Container Apps). Let's try it on a fully functional version of the endpoint!

1. Return to your deployed Azure Container App in Tab 5️⃣ 
1. Add a `/docs` suffix to the URL and browse to that path - you will see: **FastAPI** page
1. Expand the `POST` section by clicking the arrow
    - click `Try it out` to make inputs editable
    - enter `Tell me about your tents` for **question**
    - enter `2` for **customer_id**
    - enter `[]` for **chat_history**
    - enter **Execute** to run the endpoint with the provided parameters.
    
You will get a response body with `question`, `answer` and `context` components. 

- **Check** `question` -  is the customer's question the same as that typed in the chat window on the Contoso Outdoor website
- **Check** `answer` -  is the chatbot's response to the customer's `question`, as generated by this RAG application
- **Check** `context` - is the additional information provided to the Generative AI model being used by it used to ground its answer.
    - In this app, that includes information about products relevant to the customer question.
    - The products selected may depend on `customer_id` and the associated order history. 
    - The web app provides `chat_history` from the chat window - which can serve as additional context that the model can use to ground the response.

!!! note "Exercise → Repeat exercise with a different customer ID (between 1 and 12). How did the response change?"


✅ | Your Contoso Chat AI is deployed - and works with valid inputs!

## Let's Connect The Dots

!!! info "Recall that the [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation#how-does-rag-work) works by *retrieving* relevant knowledge from your data stores, and _augmenting_ the user query with it to create an enhanced prompt - which _generates_ the final response."

To implement this RAG pattern, we need to execute three steps:

1. **Setup data sources** and populate them with our data (product catalog, customer orders)
1. **Create [indexes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation#how-does-rag-work)** for efficient information retrieval by LLMs (e.g., find matching products)
1. **Connect our Azure AI project** to access data/indexes code-first, for use in processing steps.

In the previous section we setup the data sources (provisioning infra) and populated them with data (post-provisioning scripts) as follows:

1. **Azure CosmosDB** - loaded **12 records** from `data/customer_info`, got _customers_ database.
1. **Azure AI Search** - loaded **20 records** from `data/product_info`, got _contoso-products_ index.

In this section, we verified these steps and checked off the first two items on our RAG checklist above. In the next section (Ideation with Prompty) we'll see how we achieve the third item with a code-first approach that makes use of the Azure AI Search, Azure CosmosDB and Azure OpenAI services through their Azure SDKs.

_Now you understand the application architecture, and have a sense for the retail copilot API, it's time to dig into the codebase and understand the three stages of our GenAIOps workflow - ideation, evaluation, and operationalization_.
