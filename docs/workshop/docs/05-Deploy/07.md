# 7. Redeploy Copilot to Azure

The workshop began with a _pre-provisioned_ version of the Contoso Chat application on Azure Container Apps. Now that you have modified elements of the app and tested them out locally, you might want to _redeploy_ the application. 

Because we use `azd` for provisioning and deployment, this is as simple as calling `azd up` (to push all changes in both infrastructure and application) or running `azd hooks run postprovision` if you want to only rebuild and deploy the application in _this_ specific project.
