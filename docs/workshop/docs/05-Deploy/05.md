# 5. Testing Code Changes Live

We looked at how we can test and debug the chat AI application. Now let's use this in practice to test changes to our solution **interactively** so we can iterate faster. Leave the FastAPI dev server running - recall that it supports hot reload, so changes made to code are reflected instantly.

!!! note "Sidebar: Understanding API Routes and Requests"

    By default, API requests are sent to a server "endpoint" (or route) that the server listens on, for incoming requests.

    - The "/" route is the default API server URL that returns a message (as a health check)
    - The "/api/create_response" route is an enhanced URL that listens for copilot requests.

    Our API server is implemented in the `src/api/main.py` file. Let's see how it handles these requests:

    - See: `@app.get("/")` - requests to the default route ("/") get a "Hello World" health check message.
    - `@app.put("/api/create_response")` - requests to this endpoint are parsed, with query parameters extracted and passed to the `get_response` function (copilot), with the response then returned to the caller.

## 1. Code Change Options

We can think of code changes being made at different stages of the processing workflow:

- _Modify `src/main.py`_ - to change API endpoint routes or incoming request processing.
- _Modify `chat_request.py`_ - to change how the `get_request` workflow is orchestrated. 
- _Modify `chat.prompty`_ - to change the model prompt behavior (template, configuration). 

Let's try the first option, and change how an incoming API request is handled.

## 2. Change API handler

**Let's change how the API server handles the health-check request on "/"**. This is a simple change that lets us validate automatic reload on the FastAPI server.

1. Make sure the `fastapi dev src/main.py` command is still running
1. **Check:** the browser is showing the "/" route on `*.github.dev` with "Hello, World"
1. Open `src/api/main.py`
    - Find  **line 46** - should currently say: `return {"message": "Hello World"}`
    - Modify it to: `return {"message": "Hello Microsoft AI Tour"}`
1. Return to the browser page above.
    - **Check:** The displayed message should have updated to "Hello Microsoft AI Tour"
