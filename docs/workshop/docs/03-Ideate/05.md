# 3.5 Convert Prompty To Code

### 1. Add Code For Prompty

1. First, let's copy over final versions of our Prompty file and input data:

    ```
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-3.prompty .
    ```
    ```
    cp ../docs/workshop/src/1-build/chat-3.json .
    ```

1. In the Explorer pane, right-click on the new `chat-3.prompty` file and select _"Add Code > Add Prompty Code"_. This creates a new Python file `chat-3.py` and opens it in VS Code.

1. Run the default code by clicking the play icon. **It will fail with an error** indicating there are missing environment variables. Let's fix that.

### 2. Update Default Code

1. Add the three lines below to the top of `chat-3.py`:

    ```python
    ## Load environment variables
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    ```
    
    !!! info "These lines load environment varianbles from your `.env` file for use in the Python script.`"       
    
1. Execute `chat-3.py` by clicking the "play" at the top-right of its VS Code window. You should now see a valid response being generated.

    !!! tip "Press Alt-Z (or Cmd-Z on Mac) to toggle word wrap. This will make the prompts in the `.prompty` file easier to read within the limited screen view."

### 3. Troubleshooting

_The [Prompty](https://prompty.ai) tooling is in preview. This section captures any issues and workarounds that can be used to resolve them (till fixed in a new release)._

In the previous step, you may still get an error citing a missing `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` variable. **This will be fixed in an upcoming release. For now, here is the workaround:**

- **Check**: The previous step created a `prompty.json` file created in the same folder.
- **Check**: That file will has a line with `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` specified
- **Make Fix**: Delete this line from the file and save changes.
- **Test Fix**: Re-run the prompty. It should now work.

**Why did this happen?** - The `prompty.json` file is auto-generated to reflect the default prompty settings used by the VS Code extension so that the runtime execution operates consistently. In this case the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` was included by accident, likely due to the presence of a default model configuration in VS Code that we were not actively using.
