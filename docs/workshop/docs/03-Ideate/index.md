# 3. Ideate With Prompty

    ![Dev Workflow](./../img/workshop-developer-flow.png)

    We currently have these 5 tabs open in our development environment.

    1. Github Repo - starting tab 1️⃣
    1. GitHub Codespaces 2️⃣
    1. Azure Portal 3️⃣
    1. Azure AI Studio 4️⃣
    1. Azure Container Apps 5️⃣

    We also have a fully-provisioned Azure infrastructure (backend), successfully deployed the first version of our application - and tested it manually, with a single input. **It's time to move into the `IDEATE` phase of our workflow.**

_Now it's time to understand how that application was developed - and specifically, understand how we can go from "prompt to prototype" in the **Ideation** phase of our developer workflow_.
