# 1️⃣ | Getting Started

These are the instructions for **Self Guided** learners for this workshop. By the end of this section, you should have provisioned your Azure infrastructure yourself, and validated your local development environment in GitHub Codespaces.

!!! info "First → Review [ 0️⃣ | Pre-requisites](./../00-Before-You-Begin/index.md) before you begin setup"


## 1. Setup Dev Environment

The workshop requires a laptop with a modern browser installed. All steps happen in the browser, using GitHub Codespaces to connect to a development container in the cloud. 

!!! tip "TIP: USE PRIVATE OR INCOGNITO MODE IN BROWSER"

      You may have an enterprise Azure or GitHub account that you are logged into, for work. To avoid conflicts for this workshop, we recommend opening a new browser window in incognito mode (private mode) for this workshop. Any modern browser will do - we recommend Microsoft Edge and using _Tab Groups_ to organize your work for clarity.
      
_In this section, you will create a copy of the repository in your profile and use it for exploration. Then GitHub Codespaces to get a pre-built development environment ready to go._
