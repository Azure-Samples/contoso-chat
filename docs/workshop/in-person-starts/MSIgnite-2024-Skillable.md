- **Password:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password++

## 3. Skillable VM

- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Password+++

## 4. Time Tracking

The instruction panel has a _countdown timer_ at the top (with "Hours Remaining" for lab completion).
- It should have **at least** _1h 15 min_ at the start.
- When it nears expirty, you will be notified with options.
- When timer expires, the VM will terminate automatically.

## 5. Revisit At Home

By the end of this workshop, you will have a copy of the sample app in your GitHub profile.


You will walk away with a copy of the application in your GitHub profile. You can revisit that at home, with the _Self-Guided_ workshop option, to complete the workshop at your own pace, with your Azure subscription.
