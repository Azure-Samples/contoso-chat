## 1. Lab Instructions

**Instructions Link:** ++https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat/workshop++

The lab instructions are available at the link above. To get started:
1. Open a new incognito (private) browser window on your workstation
1. Copy the link above into the browser address bar and navigate to it.
1. Start from the **Setup** section to make best use of your time.

## 2. Azure Credentials

You will make use of a temporary Azure subscription assigned to this lab instance, with the credentials below. You will need these for the setup stage of the workshop. Verify that you see both _Username_ and _Password_ values below.

- **Username:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username++
- **Password:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password++

## 3. Skillable VM

The login screen to the left corresponds to the Skillable Windows VM for your lab instance. You should **NOT** need to use it for this lab - but it may prove helpful for troubleshooting issues with proctor help.

Use these credentials to login (username may be preset):

- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Username+++
- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Password+++

## 4. Time Tracking

This instruction panel has a _Countdown Timer_ (at the top) showing _"Hours Remaining"_ for lab completion  (with _1h 15 min_ to start).
 - When the timer expires, the VM will terminate automatically
 - When it nears expiry, you will be notified so you can cleanup

You will walk away with a copy of the application in your GitHub profile. You can revisit that at home, with the _Self-Guided_ workshop option, to complete the workshop at your own pace, with your Azure subscription.
