!!! note "Microsoft AI Tour 2024 Registration Is Live"

    The workshop is offered as an **instructor-led** session (WRK550) on the **Prototype to Production** track:

    > Use Azure AI Studio to build, evaluate, and deploy a customer support chat app. This custom copilot uses a RAG architecture built with Azure AI Search, Azure CosmosDB and Azure OpenAI to return responses grounded in the product and customer data.

    - [**Register to attend**](https://aitour.microsoft.com/) at a tour stop near you.
    - [**View Lab resources**](https://aka.ms/aitour/wrk550) to continue your journey.

The workshop supports 3 delivery formats:
 
1. **Instructor Led** üëâüèΩ Bring your laptop. You get a subscription with pre-provisioned infra.
1. **Partner Led** üëâüèΩ Bring your laptop. You may need your own subscription and self-deploy infra.
1. **Self-guided** üëâüèΩ Bring your laptop and your own subscription. You must self-deploy infra.

Provisioning infrastructure (e.g., in self-deploy mode) takes **35-40** minutes. The workshop itself can be completed in **60-75 minutes** in-venue. The self-guided option allows you to explore this at your own pace beyond the default workshop scope.

_If you find this sample useful, consider giving us a star on GitHub! If you have any questions or comments, consider filing an Issue on the [source repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat)_.

## 1. Learning Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Use Azure AI Studio as a code-first platform for building custom copilots‚Äã

* Prototype a custom copilot on VS Code with powerful tools (Prompty, Promptflow, Codespaces)‚Äã

* Optimize your custom copilot with manual testing & AI-assisted evaluation (Quality, Safety)‚Äã

* Operationalize your custom copilot by deploying to Azure AI Studio (Monitoring, Filters, Logs)‚Äã

* Customize the sample to suit your application scenario (data, functions, frameworks, models)

If you've gotten this far, you have already:

* Launched the Lab instructions
* Reviewed pre-requisites for this workshop
* Forked the repository for this workshop
* Launched GitHub Codespaces
* Opened this file in VS Code Online

## 2. Log into your Azure account from the terminal

We have provided you with a temporary Azure subscription for you to use with this workshop. It is pre-deployed with all the resources you will need.

You can find the username and password at the bottom of the Lab Instructions window titled "Build a Retail Copilot Code-First on Azure AI".

* Find the username and password for your Azure subscription in the Lab Instructions window.

* Click the Terminal Pane in the VS Code online window

    * It's just below these instructions, in the bottom-right corner of your browser

* Copy the command below and paste it into the command line, and hit ENTER:

    * azd auth login --use-device-code

* Copy the code show to your clipboard, and then click enter. 

    * A new browser window will open

* If you are prompted to select an account, click "Use another account"

    * This can happen if you have previously used this browser to log Azure using yout own account, for example

* Copy your username from the Lab Instructions window, paste it in, and click Next

* Copy your username from the Lab Instructions window, paste it in, and click Sign In

* At the prompt "Are you trying to sign in to Microsoft Azure CLI?", click Continue

* Close the "Microsoft Azure Cross-platform Command Line Interface" tab

## 3. Try out the completed app

There is a complete working contoso-web app deployed by Skillable

* Click on the URL to launch the contoso-web app

* Observe logged-in state of Sarah Lee

* Scroll through the page to see the product catalog

* Click on the Cozy Nights Sleeping Bag to see the product information page

    * Description, features, reviews, FAQ, return policy, cautions, user guide, warranty, technical specifications

* Click Back to return to home page

* Click "chat" icon

* Questions to ask:

```
What can you do?
What is a good sleeping bag for winter use?
How much is the Cozy Nights Sleeping bag?
How should I take care of it?
What did I order last time?
```
## 3. Explore the resources

We have deployed several resources to your Azure Subscription that will be used in this RAG architecture. 

First, lets take a look at the resources as they appear in the Azure Portal. Then, we'll use the Codespaces terminal to take a look at some of them in a little more detail.

### 3.1 Visit Azure Portal

* Open a new browser tab for the Azure Portal 
    - **Navigate to** https://portal.azure.com **in a new tab**.
    - You may be prompted to **log in**, in which case use the Username and Password provided in the Skillable Lab window.
 
* Launch the "Resource Groups" tool
    - **Click the hamburger menu** (in the top-left corner)
    - Select **Resource Groups**

* Explore the contents of the resource group
    - **Click** the name of the resource group: **rg-AITOUR**
    - You will see: Overview page with 14 resources listed.
    - Look at the Type column and see that you have the following resources deployed:
        - **Search service**: (Azure AI Search, a vector database to store product information)
        - **Azure Cosmos DB account**(Azure CosmosDB, a relational database to store customer data and orders)    
        - **Azure AI services** (endpoints for OpenAI models used in the application)
        - **Azure AI hub** (a hub in Azure AI Studio collecting the shared resources used in the app)
        - **Azure AI project** (the project in Azure AI Studio containing the assets for the RAG application)

### Customer data: CosmosDB

Customer data is sourced from a collection of JSON files and then loaded into Cosmos DB.

* **Explore** the JSON files in [../data/customer_info](../data/customer_info), for example [customer_info_1.json](../data/customer_info/customer_info_1.json)
    * Customer id, name, age, contact info, membership tier
    * Product Purchase history
        * Product info, purchase date, price
* The script used to load the data into Cosmos DB has already been run for you. Take a look at the Notebook version [../data/customer_info/create-cosmos-db.ipynb](../data/customer_info/create-cosmos-db.ipynb), but don't run any cells
* **Open the notebook** [../data/customer_info/investigate-cosmos-db.ipynb](../data/customer_info/investigate-cosmos-db.ipynb)
* **Run each of the cells** to take a look at the data in Cosmos DB

### Product purchase history: CosmosDB

The product data you see in CosmosD was sourced from a CSV file:

* **Open** [../data/product_info/products.csv](../data/product_info/products.csv)
  * Product id
  * Name
  * Price
  * Category
  * Brand
  * Description

Observe that these details match those in the customer order history stored in Cosmos DB.

### Product information: Azure AI Search

TODO: Have the user use the CLI to do some test searches on the Azure AI Search.

### Model endpoints: Azure AI Studio

 1. Once provisioning completes, monitor progress for app deployment.
    - Visit the [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/build)
    - Click Sign In if necessary
    - Look for an AI Project associated with the above resource group
    - Click `Deployments` to track the status of the application deployment
 1. Test the deployed endpoint from Azure AI Studio
    - Click the newly-created `chat-deployment-xx` endpoint listed
    - In the details page, click the `Test` tab for a built-in testing sandbox
    - In the `Input` box, enter a new query in this format and submit it:
        ```
        {"question": "Tell me about hiking shoes", "customerId": "2", "chat_history": []}
        ```
    - If successful, the response will be printed in the area below this prompt.

You can find your deployed retail copilot's _Endpoint_ and _Primary Key_ information on the deployment details page in the last step. Use them to configure your preferred front-end application (e.g., web app) to support a customer support chat UI capability that interacts with the deployed copilot in real time.
