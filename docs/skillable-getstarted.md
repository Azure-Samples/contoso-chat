These instructions are for participants of the Workshop "Build a Retail Copilot Code-First on Azure AI" at Microsoft AI Tour 2024-2025.

TODO: UPDATE SKILLABLE LAB TO POINT TO github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat/docs/skillable-getstarted.md

## Pre-Requisites

To participate in this workshop, you will need:

1. Your own laptop.
   * It need only be capable of running a browser and GitHub Codespaces, so almost any laptop will do.
   * A recent version of Edge, Chrome or Safari is recommended.
1. A GitHub Account.
   * If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a free account](https://github.com/signup) now.
   * After this workshop is complete, you will have a fork of the "contoso-chat" repository in your GitHub account, which includes all the materials you will need to reproduce this workshop at home.
1. (recommended) Familiarity with Visual Studio Code. 
   * We will run all code in GitHub Codespaces, a virtualized Linux machine, instead of your local laptop. We won't be running anything on your laptop directly.
   * VS Code Online will be our development environment in GitHub Codespaces.
   * If you are familiar with running Codespaces within VS Code Desktop on your laptop, feel free to do so. 
1. (preferred) Familiarity with the `bash` shell. 
    * We'll be using `bash` to run commands in the VS Code terminal.
1. (preferred) Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks
    * We'll be creating Python scripts and running them from the command line and from Notebooks.
