# Part 1: Get Started (Deconstructing Contoso Chat - An Interactive Workshop)

Thie instructions are for participants of the Workshop "Build a Retail Copilot Code-First on Azure AI".

This workshop is presented as an **instructor-led** session at Microsoft AI Tour 2024-2025 on the Prototype to Production track. If you're not at an AI Tour event right now, you can register for an upcoming event in a city near you.

- [**Register to attend**](https://aitour.microsoft.com/) at a tour stop near you.
- [**View Lab resources**](https://aka.ms/aitour/wrk550) to continue your journey.

If you are at instructor-led lab, you have already reviewed the prerequisites you will need to complete the workshop. If you're not at an instructor-led lab and haven't done so already, you can find this information by reading [README.md](README.md#requirements-for-participants).

In this lab, you will use your own browser to log into GitHub and Azure. (**Tip**: if you have your own Azure account, and are using a lab-provided account,
  you might want to open the Azure Portal in a new profile or an incognito window, 
  to avoid conflicts with the temporary Azure account used in this lab.)

## Learning Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Use Azure AI Studio as a code-first platform for building custom copilots​

* Prototype a custom copilot on VS Code with powerful tools (Prompty, Promptflow, Codespaces)​

* Optimize your custom copilot with manual testing & AI-assisted evaluation (Quality, Safety)​

* Operationalize your custom copilot by deploying to Azure AI Studio (Monitoring, Filters, Logs)​

* Customize the sample to suit your application scenario (data, functions, frameworks, models)

## Log into GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces will be our development environment for this workshop. You will need to log into your own GitHub account and copy (fork) the workshop materials to your account. Let's do that now.

1. **Open a new browser window** on your laptop. 

1. **Click the link** below to your clipboard: 
    * `https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-chat`

1. **Paste the link in your browser** to open the GitHub repository.

1. **Sign in to GitHub** if you aren't logged in already, using your own GitHub account credentials.

1. Click **Fork** in the top-right corner of the page

1. In the "Create a new fork" page, scroll down and **uncheck** the option "Copy the main branch only".

   * **Important**: If you forget to uncheck that option, you will need to delete your fork and try again. Ask a proctor for assistance.

1. Click the **Create Fork** button.

   * You should now be at the page `https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/contoso-chat` within your own GitHub account.
   
   * You now have a copy (known as a fork) of this workshop repository in your own GitHub account! Feel free to play with it, you won't break anything.

1. Use the branch selection drop-down on the left side that now reads **main** and select the branch **aitour-fy25**.

1. Click the green **<> Code** button in the top-right part of the page, click the **Codespaces** tab, and then click **Create codespace on aitour-fy25**.

1. This step takes a few minutes. The instructor will give you an overview of the session, and then you can begin work on your own in the Codespaces environment in your browser when it's ready.
