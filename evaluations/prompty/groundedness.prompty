  question: What feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks instead of each light having a line-to-low voltage transformer?
  context: Track lighting, invented by Lightolier, was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting, and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall. It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension
  answer: The main transformer is the object that feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks.

System:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.
User:
You will be presented with a context and an ANSWER about that context. You need to decide whether the ANSWER is entailed by the context by choosing one of the following rating:
1. 5: The ANSWER follows logically from the information contained in the context.
2. 1: The ANSWER is logically false from the information contained in the context.
3. an integer score between 1 and 5 and if such integer score does not exists, use 1: It is not possible to determine whether the ANSWER is true or false without further information.

Read the passage of information thoroughly and select the correct answer from the three answer labels. Read the context thoroughly to ensure you know what the context entails.

Note the ANSWER is generated by a computer system, it can contain certain symbols, which should not be a negative factor in the evaluation.
